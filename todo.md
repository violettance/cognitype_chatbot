## üìù Notes

### Model Compatibility Issues:
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: May require more advanced models than Mistral-7B
- **Agentic Tool Use**: Current setup not designed for tool integration
- **RAG Implementation**: Would need significant memory system redesign
- **Fine-tuning**: Requires substantial computational resources and data

### Priority Matrix:
- **Quick Wins**: UI improvements, security enhancements
- **Medium Effort**: Alternative models, memory improvements
- **Long-term**: RAG, agentic features, advanced reasoning

### Development Approach:
1. Focus on UI/UX improvements first (user satisfaction)
2. Implement security measures (essential for production)
3. Add alternative models (expand capabilities)
4. Consider advanced features based on user feedback
